# Pace Your Pulse Documentation
## Description
Documentation for the pace_your_pulse repository.

## Generate documentation
The documentation generation for the project is simply done by executing the `dartdoc` command below. Before executing it, however, make sure that the `dartdoc` executable is added to your global path variables. If not, the absolute path will have to be specified when running the following command.
  
```
dartdoc --exclude="dart:core,dart:async,dart:collection,dart:convert,dart:developer,dart:io,dart
:isolate,dart:math,dart:typed_data,dart:ui"
```
